Truth: Americans are more likely to be struck and killed by lightning than to impersonate another voter.
Truth: Even after you've registered to vote, under certain circumstances you can be erased from the system. Check your registration status ahead of time to avoid any unpleasant surprises on Election Day.
Truth: State and local elections matter too. Your vote at these lower levels could lead to more direct results and policies that benefit your community.
Truth: Amendments to the Constitution tell states what they cannot do (deny the vote based on race, gender or age, for example), but nothing in the Constitution tells the states that they must ensure all citizens can vote. Check the voting laws in your state and use your vote to vote for others who can't!
Truth: It may not seem like it in the grand scheme of things. But there have been various cases where races were determined from a single vote difference. So yes, every vote does matter.
